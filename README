WebSocket server for Lua
uses the following:
LuaSocket
LuaCrypto
LuaBitOp
dkjson
my Lua ext library
my ThreadManager library

Timer is currently based on gettimeofday, which is loaded via LuaJIT's FFI, 
but if you wish to use non-FFI Lua you can use the l_gettimeofday lua binding function
(or even os.clock or os.time if you don't mind the resolution).
